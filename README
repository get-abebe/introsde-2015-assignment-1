Introduction to service design and engineering
Assignment 01: Reading/Writing objects to and from XML and JSON

In this assignment i have build, ivy, lib and src folder. In the last folder(Src), 
there are four packages under it health profile, jaxbClass, model and people.generated.
Besides the folders, there are xml,json and xsd files in the same directory with the folders.

In order to do run tasks number 1 to 3, first i have created people.xml file and then i created
 model package and put two java classes(health profile and person) in this package.
Finally, i created HealthProfileReader java class under healthProfile package which implement all tasks.
For tasks number 4 to 6 (marshaling and un-marshaling),firstly i have created three person using java objects
and then marshaling to xml file by JAXBMarshaller class and put in the same directory with the folders
as Personmarshhjaxb.xml.Secondly, for un-marshaling i changed the Personmarshhjaxb.xml to Personmarshhjaxb.xsd for
validation and did the un-marshal by JAXBUNMarshaller class. Finally, i created the person.json file
by using JaxbJson class.All the marshaling and un-marshaling tasks corresponds to java classes
which are found in jaxbClass and model packages.

To execute the code,Open your terminal window in your local my ass. folder and run execute.evaluation
and then press enter to continue and see all the outputs.
I have done something different!!
