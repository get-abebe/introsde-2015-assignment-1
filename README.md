Introduction to service design and engineering Assignment 01: Reading/Writing objects to and from XML and JSON

In this assignment i have ivy and src folder. In the last folder(Src), there are four packages under it: healthProfile, jaxbClass, model and people.generated. Besides the folders, there are also xml,json and xsd files in the same directory with the folders.

In order to do run tasks number 1 to 3, first i have created people.xml file and then i created model package and put two java classes(health profile and person) in this package. And then, i created HealthProfileReader java class under healthProfile package which implement all tasks. For tasks number 4 to 6 (marshaling and un-marshaling),firstly i have created three person using java objects and then marshaling to xml file by JAXBMarshaller class and put in the same directory with the folders as Personmarsh.xml. Secondly, for un-marshaling i changed the Personmarsh.xml to Personmarsh.xsd for validation and did the un-marshal by JAXBUNMarshaller class. Finally, i created the person.json file by using JaxbJson class from java objects. All the marshaling and un-marshaling tasks corresponds to java classes which are found in jaxbClass, people.generated and model packages.

To execute the code, Open your terminal window in your local my ass. folder and write ant execute.evaluation and then press enter to see all the outputs.
